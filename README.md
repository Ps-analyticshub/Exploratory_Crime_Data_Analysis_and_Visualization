# 📊 Crime Data Analysis & Power BI Dashboard

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Interactive Power BI dashboard** built on crime-related data.  
The objective is to analyze crime patterns, resolution status, victim demographics, and geographic distribution, and to transform insights into a **clear, decision-ready dashboard**.

---

## 📈 Key Objectives
- Analyze overall crime volume and trends
- Identify pending vs solved case distribution
- Understand crime patterns by domain, weapon, and city
- Analyze victim demographics (age group & gender)
- Enable interactive, filter-driven exploration

---

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides a consolidated view of crime insights using professional visual design principles.

### 🔹 Key KPIs
- **Total Crimes** – Total reported crime cases  
- **Solved Cases** – Successfully resolved cases  
- **Pending Cases** – Ongoing / unresolved cases  
- **Average Victim Age** – Mean age of victims across all cases  

---

### 🔹 Visual Analysis
- Crime distribution by **Crime Domain**
- Case Status analysis (Solved vs Pending)
- Weapon usage distribution
- Age group-wise crime analysis
- City-wise crime concentration (Top 10 Cities)
- Monthly crime trend analysis

---

### 🔹 Advanced Power BI Features
- Interactive slicers for:
  - Crime Domain
  - Crime Month
  - Victim Gender
  - Age Group
  - Professional color semantics for analytical clarity

---

## 🧠 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed using Python to:
- Clean and preprocess data
- Handle missing and inconsistent values
- Identify trends and distributions
- Validate insights before dashboard development

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib 
- **Power BI**: Data modeling, DAX, Dashboard design  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: EDA workflow  

---

## 🎯 Key Insights
- Certain crime domains contribute significantly to pending cases
- Crime concentration is higher in a limited number of cities
- Specific weapon categories dominate reported crimes
- Crime trends show noticeable variation across months
- Adult age groups are the most affected demographic

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Add crime resolution rate KPI
- Incorporate predictive crime trend analysis
- Introduce drill-through pages for city-level insights
- Automate data refresh with real-time sources

---

## 📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates the ability to:
- Perform structured exploratory data analysis
- Convert analytical insights into business-friendly dashboards
- Apply advanced Power BI features for enhanced user experience
- Design dashboards aligned with professional industry standards
